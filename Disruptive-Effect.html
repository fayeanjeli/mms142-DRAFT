        <h1>Disruptive Effect</h1>
	<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p><b>ABOUT ME</b>As people get accustomed to using technology in everyday life, researchers and scientists strive to create a technology to initiate understanding between humans and technology and to increase productivity. Thus, virtual voice assistants were created and because of its accuracy, availability and affordability it has become a disruptive technology. The common features of a virtual voice assistant is to make and receive calls, report weather information and news, provide directions and schedules, play music and video, control home appliances, elderly care and assistance, emergency services and shopping. (Noten, 2018).

Financial Industry
The financial field is heavily influenced by digital banking technology. Given the financial system’s sensitive nature, users will be hesitant to engage in the deposit and withdrawal of money. Individuals expressed their concern that voice assistants are inside a home, a shared space, and talking about authentication methods may pose some risks. (Answer Lab Research, 2018). Still, because of the features of NLP in managing difficult tasks smoothly and accurately, many banks today have adopted virtual voice assistants to show customers their checking, savings, transactions, billing due dates, and etc (Noten, 2018).

Marketing Industry

When shopping for products, companies take extra care in ensuring that their products are visually appealing, with their brand logo attached. These days, customers need only to look at pixels of their preferred products due to the advent of online shopping. Amazon utilizes NLP to analyze a customer’s behavior through their browsing history, wish lists, and buying history in order for them to provide better customer satisfaction and experience. (Durairaj, 2020). Even buying online can be done with the help of a voice assistant. There is also the advent of voice commerce which utilizes voice commands to purchase goods online. (Caughill, 2018). 
As more businesses boom, so do the customer demands. When there is a huge wave of customer queries, companies turn to automated chatbots to handle the inquiries. Chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) programs that use natural language processing to simulate a human conversation, utilizing texts, voice commands, or both through websites or messaging applications. (Frankenfield, 2020).  Due to popular and convenient demand, chatbots are now being used more often instead of humans.

Healthcare industry
Healthcare workers record various amounts of patients’ data. It is unavoidable that they may encounter lost records and illegible notes. This is where NLP comes in handy. NLP has the ability to examine a multitude of records as well as distinguish relationships between the patient’s diagnosis and medications. (Stiehler, 2018). This shows NLP’s multifunctional nature which consumes less time and increases comfort, convenience, and accuracy.
