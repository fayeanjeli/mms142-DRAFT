	<p> As people get accustomed to using technology in everyday life, researchers and scientists strive to create a technology that initiates understanding between humans and technology which increases productivity. Thus, virtual voice assistants rise. And, because of its accuracy, availability, and affordability, it has become a disruptive technology. The usual features of a virtual voice assistant are to make and receive calls, report weather information and news, provide directions and schedules, play music and videos, control home appliances, elderly care and assistance, emergency services, and shopping (Noten, 2018).</p><br>

	<h2>Financial Industry</h2><br>
	<p>The financial field is (heavily) influenced by digital banking technology. We know the financial system’s sensitive nature. With that, users will be hesitant to engage in the deposit and withdrawal of money. Individuals express their concerns about voice assistants. They are inside a home, a shared space, and talking about authentication methods may pose risks (Answer Lab Research, 2018). Still, because of the features of NLP in managing challenging tasks smoothly and accurately, many banks today have adopted virtual voice assistants to show customers their checking, savings, transactions, billing due dates, etc. (Noten, 2018).</p><br><br>
	<h2>Marketing Industry</h2><br>
	<p>When shopping for products, companies take extra care to ensure that their products are visually appealing with their brand logo attached. These days, customers need only to look at pixels of their preferred products due to the advent of online shopping. Amazon utilizes NLP to analyze a customer’s behavior. It happens through browsing history, wish lists, and purchase history; this is usually done to provide better customer satisfaction and experience (Durairaj, 2020). Even buying online can be done with the help of a voice assistant. There is also the advent of voice commerce which utilizes voice commands to purchase goods online. (Caughill, 2018). As more businesses boom, the same goes with the customer demands. When there is an immense wave of customer queries, companies turn to automated chatbots to handle the inquiries. Chatbots are artificial intelligence (AI) programs that use natural language processing (NLP) to simulate a human conversation, utilizing texts, voice commands, or both through websites or messaging applications (Frankenfield, 2020). Due to popular and convenient demand, chatbots are now being used more often instead of humans.</p><br><br>
	<h2>Healthcare industry</h2><br>
	<p>Healthcare workers record various amounts of patients’ data. It is unavoidable that they may encounter lost records and illegible notes. This situation is where NLP comes in handy. NLP can examine hordes of records and distinguish relationships between the patient’s diagnosis and medications (Stiehler, 2018). With that, NLP shows a multifunctional nature that consumes less time and increases comfort, convenience, and accuracy.</p><br>
